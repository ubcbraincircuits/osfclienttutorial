# OSF Client Tutorial
This Jupyter notebook is a tutorial on [osfclient](https://github.com/osfclient/osfclient), a Python library and command-line program for implementing simple actions on [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io/), such as uploading and downloading files.

## Installation
Note that `osfclient` is no longer an active project (see this [comment](https://github.com/osfclient/osfclient/issues/169#issuecomment-524444154) from a former maintainer) so I created a fork of the repository to fix bugs and make improvements. This tutorial uses my version of osfclient, which can be installed with the following command:

```console
  pip install git+https://github.com/ubcbraincircuits/osfclient
```

## Disclaimer
This notebook was created for the [UBC Brain Circuits Cluster](https://braincircuits.centreforbrainhealth.ca/) and placed in this repository so that it can be of help to other users. It was written independently of the developers and maintainers of osfclient.
